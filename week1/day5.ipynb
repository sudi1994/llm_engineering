      "“AI can code now, so why bother learning programming?”\n",
      "I hear this increasingly. Some parents are steering kids away from computer science. Some students are abandoning math. The logic seems sound: if AI does it cheaper, why invest years learning it?\n",
      "I think this misses the point entirely.\n",
      "I’ve been teaching my son Sebastian to program since he was 7. Not because I expect him to compete with AI writing code, but because programming rewires how you think. It teaches you that precision matters. That what you say is what happens. There’s no room for “well, I meant something else.” That clarity of thought transfers everywhere.\n",
      "The challenge? Keeping an 10 year old engaged consistently. I use games. I keep sessions short. I don’t do it every day. Variety and fun matter more than intensity.\n",
