      "Welcome! I'm a large language model created by Mistral AI. Here’s a quick overview of my capabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Natural Language Understanding & Generation**\n",
      "- I can understand and generate human-like text in multiple languages.\n",
      "- I can answer questions, explain concepts, summarize texts, and even help with creative writing (stories, poems, etc.).\n",
      "- I can assist with grammar, spelling, and style improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Knowledge & Information**\n",
      "- I have been trained on a vast amount of data up to **2023**, so I can provide information on a wide range of topics (science, history, technology, etc.).\n",
      "- I can help with research, fact-checking, and learning new subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Problem-Solving & Reasoning**\n",
      "- I can assist with math problems, logic puzzles, and step-by-step explanations.\n",
      "- I can help debug code, explain algorithms, and suggest optimizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Creative & Productivity Tasks**\n",
      "- Brainstorming ideas (business, content, projects).\n",
      "- Writing and editing (emails, essays, reports).\n",
      "- Generating code snippets in multiple programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Conversational & Interactive Abilities**\n",
      "- I can engage in multi-turn conversations, adapt to different tones (formal, casual, humorous), and provide personalized responses.\n",
      "- I can role-play scenarios (e.g., interviews, customer service simulations).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Limitations**\n",
      "- I don’t have real-time internet access (my knowledge cutoff is 2023).\n",
      "- I can’t perform physical tasks or access personal data unless provided in the conversation.\n",
      "- While I strive for accuracy, I may occasionally make mistakes—always verify critical information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **How Can I Help You Today?**\n",
      "Feel free to ask me anything—whether it's learning something new, solving a problem, or just having a fun chat! 😊\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like to test any specific capability?\n"
